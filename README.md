#Data Validation

App in progress, depends on several custom fields.  

#####FAQ

######Why am I not seeing all the teams in my project scope? 

The report will only show teams where data is not valid.  If none of a team's data in the selected release violates the rules, the team will not be shown here.  

While the bar chart should have every team that has stories or features in the current release where rules are violated, the axis on the chart does not list all teams because there a too many to list in this view.  

There is an App setting in the App called "Exclude Projects" that allows the person who set the app up to exclude certain projects from validation.  Any project selected there will not be evaluated.
